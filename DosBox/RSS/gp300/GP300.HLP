F1 - Additional  information  is available for every menu via the  F1  HELP 
     key.    Specific  help is also available for each field  on  all  data 
     entry  screens.  Generic help is available within any HELP screen  via 
     the MORE HELP function.

F2 - SERVICE  is a multi-level menu that permits access to radio  ALIGNMENT 
     and   PARTS  REPLACEMENT   screens.   Radius   contains  no   internal 
     alignment  or tuning adjustments; all alignment is performed  via  the 
     SERVICE screens.   

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

     A radio must be connected to your computer via the RIB before you will 
     be  permitted  to  access the SERVICE screens.   All  SERVICE  screens 
     access  the codeplug directly; therefore, you do NOT have to read  the 
     codeplug  data (via the GET/SAVE functions) before using  the  SERVICE 
     screens.  
 
F3 - GET/SAVE is used to read codeplug data from a radio and/or retrieve an 
     archived  codeplug from a diskette or hard disk for  editing  purposes 
     (via  the  CHANGE/VIEW function).  GET/SAVE is also  used  to  program 
     edited codeplug data back into the radio or to create an archive  file 
     on a diskette (or hard disk).  

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F4 - CHANGE/VIEW  is  a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or 
     modify  codeplug  features and option  configurations.     All  Radius  
     codeplug  parameters  are classified as either RADIO-WIDE  or  CHANNEL 
     related.  CHANGE/VIEW permits access to each of these categories.

     Unlike  the  SERVICE  function, a codeplug must be  loaded  into  your 
     computer's  memory (via the GET/SAVE functions) before you can  access 
     the CHANGE/VIEW screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW an archive file  without 
     a radio connected.

ACCESSORIES                                                            4202
You may choose to have your accessory connectory behave in one of two ways, 
"auto  sense"  or "headset only". "Auto Sense" will sample  the  microphone 
jack  each time the radio is turned on. If a PTT input is sensed, then  the 
radio will assume that the accessory is a headset. All subsequent  external 
PTT  inputs  will be ignored. If no PTT is sensed when the radio  is  first 
turned  on, then the accessory is assumed to have it's own PTT switch,  for 
example a speaker microphone.  If you choose "headset only", then the radio 
will assume that it can ignore all external PTT inputs. Thus, only a  head
set  or earpiece can be used with the radio. Speaker microphones  will  not 
function if this choice is selected.

TIME-OUT-TIMER (TOT)                                                   4203

If Enabled, the TOT will limit the maximum time allowed for any  continuous 
transmission  from  1  to 255 seconds on all  transmit  channels.   Receive 
operation is not affected by the TOT.
 
Use  the UP/DOWN arrow keys to select the desired time.  You will  see  the 
display  change  in  one second increments.  The data  field  may  also  be 
changed  by typing the desired time or "OFF" from the keyboard.  The  range
is from OFF to 255 seconds.

CONTROL BUTTONS                                                        4204

There are two control buttons  on the side of the radio, just above the PTT 
switch.  Control button 1  is the top button, which control button 2 is the
bottom button.   Each control button  may be programmed  to have a specific
function.   The choices are Volume  Set, Monitor, Nuisance Delete and None.
The default  values are  Volume Set on  control  button 1  and Monitor  on 
control button 2.

Radios  with   keypads have  four additional   control  buttons  which  are 
programmable.  Please refer to the  Radio Service Software  manual  for the
location  of these  buttons.    The  choices  are Monitor, Nuisance Delete,
Phone, Memory and None.

CHANNEL BUSY LIGHT                                                     4208

This field determines if the Channel Busy Light is enabled or disabled.  

Some reasons why you may which to disable the Channel Busy Light are:

  1. User could confuse the indicator with the low battery transmit light.
  2. Increases current drain on heavily used community repeater channels.
  3. Extraneous information if channel is carrier squelch.
  4. Extraneous information if Busy Channel Lockout is used.

LOW BATTERY                                                            4209

This field  determines the type of  Low Battery alert.   The radio can give 
several different type of feedback to the operator when  the battery is low
and  needs  to be  recharged.   There  are choices of  no  feedback  (NONE), 
flashing transmit light when keyed (LIGHT), and an audible tone in receive/
flashing transmit light when keyed (LGHT/TONE).  

The Tones and Lights fields influence what choices are available for this
field.

This  field determines  if  Forced Monitor is  enabled  or disabled.   When 
enabled,  this  feature forces  the radio  to be  in monitor  (PL disabled) 
before  the radio can be  keyed.  The operator will hear a low pitched tone 
if PTT is pressed when not in monitor and the monitor light will illuminate.
Pressing PTT a second time will cause the radio to key.

Note:  We  DO NOT recommend  using this  feature  in combination with VOX,
       Busy Channel Lockout or TX Inhibit.
.P
TIME-OUT-TIMER (TOT) REKEY TIME                                        4211

If enabled, this will be the amount of time that needs to eplapse from  the 
expiration of the time-out-timer (tot) until a retransmition can occur.  If 
no elapsed time is needed or necessary, then disable this function.

CHANGE/VIEW MODE CONFIGURATION                                         4500

MODE Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW channel specific information such 
as frequencies, squelch type, squelch codes, and scan lists.

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the radio codeplug data, but 
          instead  it  modifies  a  copy of the  data  retrieved  from  the 
          codeplug (or archive file) via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST 
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the 
          radio  or  SAVE  them  to a  new  archive  file.   Otherwise  the 
          modifications will be lost when you turn off your computer.

BUSY CHANNEL LOCKOUT                                                   4512

Busy  Channel Lockout may be enabled by choosing "Y".  When enabled,  the 
radio will be 'polite' to other users on the channel.  In other words,  the 
radio will not let you hear conversations of other users and will not allow 
you  to transmit on top of another user.  The only calls you will hear  are 
those  with  your PL code,  even if you press  the  monitor 
button.  If  you  press PTT on the radio while there is a  carrier  on  the 
channel, the radio follows this protocol:

          a. If the carrier has your PL, then you are allowed to transmit
             just like normal.
.P
          b. If the carrier has no PL or the wrong PL, then you will hear
             a  busy  tone while you hold PTT.  Release PTT and  try  again
             later. 

If you choose "N", then the radio will transmit and receive like a normal 
two-way radio.

This field determines if the Voice Operated Transmission is enabled or
disabled.  If enabled, VOX requires an accessory headset that has a Mic
audio live at all times.  

The radio will sense the presence of the headset each time the radio is 
turned on.  You may, therefore, defeat VOX by removing the headset and 
cycling the power switch.

When channel scan is enabled, the radio's software must decide as to which
way VOX will behave.  This decision will supercede all other mode 
specifications regarding VOX.

PRIORITY SAMPLING RATE                                                 4522

When the channel scan is stopped on a non-priority channel, it periodically 
"looks back" at the priority channel for activity.  The rate at which  this 
"look  back"  occurs  is  the priority sample  rate.   The  are  two  rates 
available,  slow  and fast.  Slow is 1.5 seconds between "look  backs"  and 
Fast is 0.5 seconds between "look backs".  Slow is the default.  To  change 
the sample rate use the up and down arrow keys to select the rate.

This field  sets the  length of  time that  the radio  will  remain  on the 
channel  after receiving the  end of a transmission.   The hang time should
be as short as necessary  to maintain  message continuity.   The default is
2.5 seconds  and  the values can  range  from 200 ms to 4.2 s.  If the scan
list  is all non-priority channels,  values  between 33 and  200 ms  can be 
used. Scan lists with  priority channels  CANNOT  have zero hang time.

HOME REVERT MODE                                                       4524

This field sets the Home Revert Mode for this channel.  

If  the TalkBack  feature is  enabled, then  the  radio  will act  in the 
following  manner.  If you hear activity on  a mode, then  the radio will 
stop on this active mode until the  hang timer expires.  During this hang 
time any transmission will occur on this active mode.  In all other cases, 
the radio will revert to the Home Mode.  

If  TalkBack is  disabled,   then the  radio  will always  revert  to the 
preprogrammed Homd Mode for transmissions,   regardless  of hang time.
.P
HOME REVERT MODE (cont)

The  scan will  default with TalkBack enabled when a scan list is created.

The Home Revert Mode  can be specified as any conventional channel in the 
radio.  A good practice  is to  leave this set at the default priority 1.
.P

SCAN TALK BACK                                                         4525

The conventional channel scan has the capability to revert to the home mode 
(home  revert) or stay on the busy channel (talk back) when the  microphone 
is removed from the hang-up clip.  These capabilities are now  programmable 
from  Radio  Service  Software.  The default is  home  revert.   To  change

If enabled, Active Channel  Tone will allow the  user to rotate the channel
selector to  find  the last active  channel.   When the channel is found, a
single tone  will  be heard.   The tone  will remain  associated with  that 
channel until the radio is powered off/on, or the PTT is pressed.

PRIORITY CHANNEL TONE                                                  4527

This field  determines if the Priority Channel Tone is enabled or disabled.
If enabled, a tone will be produced whenever the  radio scans to  and stops
on a priority channel.  This alerts the operator that a priority message is
being  listened to.  It is suggested that this tone be turned off if there  
is heavy use of RapidCall calling features on the priority channel.

When this screen is displayed the cursor is placed on the TYPE data  field.  
The  available  system  types  are None,  MDC1200,   QCII (QUIK CALL), DTMF
and DTMF/PHONE  (only  on phone capable radios).    On  Limited Signalling
models the available  system  types are  None, MDC1200-PTTID,  MDC1200-DOS,
QCII and DTMF/PHONE (only on phone  capable radios).  The system types  are
selected  by  using the Up/Down arrow keys.    None implies that all of the
signalling  systems in the radio are  deactivated.

MDC-1200 :
  MDC-1200 requires that each radio have a unique four digit ID number.The 
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.  The range is 
  from  0001 to DDDD.   Four zeros will show up as "NONE";  this is useful 
  when you desire the radio to "listen only". An example of a "listen only" 
  situation  might  be  a  volunteer fireman  monitoring  a  fire  dispatch 
  channel. 

MDC-1200 PTTID:
  MDC-1200 PTTID requires that the radio have an ID number.  This number 
  should be unique to the radio's system.  The ID follows the same rules as
  MDC-1200 ID, except that NONE is not allowed.
.P
DTMF :
  DTMF  requires each radio to have a unique 1 to 8 digit ID  number.   The
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.   Digits 0 to
  9, *, and # may be used.  Any unused digits may be filled in with a  '-'
  character.

QCII :
  QCII ID corresponds to tones A and B.   It requires  at two unique tones.
  The defaults are 358.6 Hz (tone A) and  903.s Hz (tone B).   The range is 
  from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz.  Don't be alarmed if the frequency that you type
  in changes by a few Hertz. This change can occur because the program must 
  calculate  the nearest  frequency that  the radio  can  understand.   You 
  will find that the error  will always be  within the acceptable  industry 
  bandwidth.

There are three different choices for this field.  The Up/Down arrow keys 
will scroll through the following choices :  Call Alert,  Call Alert/Voice, 
and  Voice  Selcall.   Call Alert leaves call indication at  the  receiving 
radio.    Call  Alert/Voice  leaves  a  call  indication  and  unmutes  the 
loudspeaker  of the receiving radio.   Voice Selcall unmutes loudspeaker on 
receiving radio but does not leave any call indication.  MDC-1200 does  not 
allow Voice Selcall call type since Voice Selcall is an inherent feature of 
all MDC-1200 signalling systems.

PL/DPL REQUIRED                                                        4707

The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y" 
implies the correct PL/DPL is required to recieve data.  "N" implies PL/DPL 
is  not  required  to receive data.  In most systems you  may  choose  "N", 
however,  when  you  share  a channel with other users who  have  the  same 
signalling type then you should choose "Y". Choosing "Y" on shared channels 
will ensure that you don't accidentally receive a call which is directed to 
another user. 

Note :  Some existing DTMF and Quik Call systems require PL stripping, and 
therefore it is recommended that an "N" be chosen in these cases.

ALERT TONE RESET                                                       4708

Alert Tone Reset only applies if the Call Type is CALL ALERT or CALL ALERT
W/VOICE.  This determines how the audible alert tone will be reset.  The
choice of AUTOMATIC means that the alert tone will be automatically reset
for you.  The choice of MANUAL means that there will be repeating alert
tones every 10 seconds that must be manually reset by pressing any button.

CONVERSATION RESET                                                     4709

Conversation Reset only applies to a Call Type of CALL ALERT W/VOICE.  When
a call alert is received you may wish the radio remain in CSQ operation for
a follow-up voice message or so that you may hold a brief conversation.  At 
the end of the conversation, you may also want the radio to return to its
previous squelch condition.  If you choose MANUAL RESET, then the radio 
will reset the squelch condition immediately after the operator presses the
monitor button.  If the choice of AUTO RESET is selected, then the radio 
will wait for seven seconds after a carrier loss and/or radio transmission
before resetting the squelch condition.

ACK PRETIME                                                            4711

  Systems   that  use Call Alert require that the radio  acknowledge  (ACK)  
that the  Call Alert has been received.  ACK Pretime is the delay from when  
the  radio  receives  a  Call Alert to when it starts  the  ACK   sequence.   
The default ACK pretime is 0.5 seconds.  If a different pretime is required  
for your  system move the cursor to the ACK Pretime data field and   change  
the time  using  the up and down arrow keys.  The range can be from 0.2  to  
2.0 seconds in 0.1 second steps.

SIGNALLING SQUELCH                                                     4714

  This  feature can either be enabled "Y" or disabled "N" using the Up/Down 
arrow  keys.  If this feature is enabled "Y",  then one of the control but
tons  can  be used to put the radio into  signalling  squelch.   If  this 
feature  is  disabled "N",  then signalling squelch is not  activated.  The 
default is "N".

  Signalling  Squelch is similar to Private Line.  When enabled,  the radio 
will  only unmute for Call Alerts and Voice Selcalls.  Like  Private  Line, 
Signalling  Squelch  can  be  disabled by pressing the  monitor  button   
You   will   find  that Signalling Squelch is  automatically  ENABLED  when 
channel scan is on.

  Data   Operated   Squelch  (DOS)  is  used with  data signalling  systems 
(such  as  MDC-1200)   to    mute    the  data  transmissions   to   reduce  
operator  annoyance.   DOS  attempts  to  mute  the  speaker  when data  is 
present  on  the channel.    DOS Holdoff keeps  the speaker muted   for   a  
preset period  of time from when carrier is  detected   by    the   squelch 
circuit.    This  allows the DOS time to detect any data  activity, further 
reducing the annoyance of data being heard from the speaker. 

  The  default  holdoff  is 0.5 seconds.    If a different holdoff time  is 
required  for   your system  move the cursor to the DOS Holdoff data  field 
and  change the   time using the Up/Down arrow keys.  The range can be from

  If you want your unit id to be sent on each Push-to-talk (PTT),  then set 
this field to "PRE", "POST", or "NONE".  "PRE" sends the id at the press of 
PTT.  "POST" sends the id upon release of PTT. If  you choose "NONE",  then

  PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are  
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They 
are  used  to  tell  the  operator   that he cannot  speak  until  the   ID  
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the  Radius.  
The  PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID has  
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the 
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to  
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated. 
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and 
using the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to either activate

  The    pretime    is  the  delay from the start  of  transmit  (when  the 
operator pushes PTT) to when  the data signalling begins.    This delay  is 
required   in  order  to  allow   the  radio    to   completely   open  the 
communications  path  through   repeaters  or  other   system   components.    
The  default   pretime   is 0.5 seconds.    If  a  different   pretime   is

FIXED RETRY WAIT                                                       4720

  When  emergency  is  activated  by  the  operator  the  radio  expects an 
acknowledge from the base station.  If no acknowledge is received then  the 
radio   will repeat the emergency sequence after a delay.  The radio always 
waits a random time greater than twice the Pretime.  The additional time is 
the  Fixed Retry Wait time.  Fixed Retry Wait is the time the  radio  waits 
between emergency tries.  The default  is 0.0  seconds (STAR default is 8.1 
seconds).   If  a  different Wait Time is required move the cursor to   the
