# Radio-Dos-Programmer
This is just a wrapper for using DOSBox to program Motorola Radios that need only have software for DOS. 
It's a total hack, but if you want to program a GP300, you can buy a DOS machine just for that, or you can use an emulator with specific settings. This program just packages all the steps for emulation.

## Adding support for more radios
1) Look for the DOS program online and make a new folder with the name of the radio.
2) make sure the file structure matches the gp300. (e.g. exe is in folder and has the same name as folder)
3) Done

## Credit
I used this [https://www.encrypted.at/motorola-gp300-programming-in-2020/] guide and just packaged it with a batch file.

## Are you a Motorola Lawyer?
I have never seen this software, I don't know how it got into my github.
